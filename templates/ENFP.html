<h3 class="text-left my-5">Cognitive Functions</h3>
<p class="lead text-justify">Psychoanalyst Carl Jung's theory suggests that personality is made up of different
    cognitive functions. The hierarchical order of these functions is what establishes personality and behavioral
    patterns. The dominant function is the one that plays the largest role in personality, although it is also supported
    by the auxiliary. The tertiary function is less developed, but still exerts some influence and become more
    pronounced as a person strengthens this area. The inferior function is largely unconscious, but represents an area
    of weakness.</p>

<p class="lead text-justify">When making decisions, ENFPs place a greater value on feelings and values rather than on logic and objective criteria.

<h3 class="text-left my-5">Tertiary: Extraverted Thinking</h3>
<p class="lead text-justify">This cognitive function is centered on organizing information and ideas in a logical way. When looking at information, the ENFP may use this function to sort through disparate data in order to efficiently spot connections. For example, an ENFP might "think out loud" as they are working through a problem, laying out all the information in order to create an easily followed train of thought.

<h3 class="text-left my-5">Inferior: Introverted Sensing</h3>
<p class="lead text-justify mb-5">ENFPs express this function by comparing the things they are experiencing in the moment to past experiences. In doing so, they are often able to call to mind memories, feelings, and senses that they associate with those events. This allows the individual to seek patterns and form expectations for future events based upon their previous experiences.</p>

<h3 class="text-left my-5">Cognitive Functions</h3>
<p class="lead text-justify">Psychoanalyst Carl Jung's theory suggests that personality is made up of different
    cognitive functions. The hierarchical order of these functions is what establishes personality and behavioral
    patterns. The dominant function is the one that plays the largest role in personality, although it is also supported
    by the auxiliary. The tertiary function is less developed, but still exerts some influence and become more
    pronounced as a person strengthens this area. The inferior function is largely unconscious, but represents an area
    of weakness.</p>

<h3 class="text-left my-5">ENTJ Characteristics</h3>
<ul class="lead text-left my-8">
    <li>People with this personality type enjoy spending time with other people. They have strong verbal skills and interacting with others helps them feel energized.</li>
    <li>ENTJ types prefer to think about the future rather than focus on the here-and-now. They usually find abstract and theoretical information more interesting than concrete details.</li>
    <li>ENTJs are planners. Making decisions and having a schedule or course of action planned out gives them a sense of predictability and control.</li>
    <li>They are highly rational, good at spotting problems, and excel at taking charge. These tendencies make them natural leaders who are focused on efficiently solving problems.</li>
    <li>One myth about ENTJs is that they are cold and ruthless. While they are not necessarily good with emotions, this does not mean that they are intentionally cruel. They are prone to hiding their own emotions and sentimentality, viewing it as a weakness that should not be made known to others.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="text-left my-5">Dominant: Extraverted Thinking</h3>
<p class="lead text-justify">"Unequivocating" expresses the resoluteness of the ENTJ's dominant function. Clarity of convictions endows these Thinkers with a knack for debate, or wanting knack, a penchant for argument. The light and heat generated by Thinking at the helm can be impressive; perhaps even overwhelming. Experience teaches many ENTJs that restraint may often be the better part of valor, lest one find oneself victorious but alone.</p>

<h3 class="text-left my-5">Auxiliary: Introverted Intuition</h3>
<p class="lead text-justify">People with this personality type are future-focused and always consider the possibilities when approaching a decision. ENTJs are forward-thinking and are not afraid of change. They trust their instincts, although they may have a tendency to regret jumping to conclusions so quickly.</p>

<h3 class="text-left my-5">Tertiary: Extraverted Sensing</h3>
<p class="lead text-justify">This cognitive function gives ENTJs an appetite for adventure. They enjoy novel experiences and may sometimes engage in thrill-seeking behaviors. Because their outward sensory focus, they also have an appreciation for beautiful things in life. They often enjoy surrounding themselves with things that they find attractive or interesting.</p>

<h3 class="text-left my-5">Inferior: Introverted Feeling</h3>
<p class="lead text-justify mb-5">Introverted feeling is centered on internal feelings and values. Emotions can be difficult area for ENTJs, and they often lack an understanding of how this part of their personality contributes to their decision-making process. When this aspect of personality is weak, ENTJs may find themselves feeling uncomfortable or awkward in settings where some type of emotional response is called for.</p>
